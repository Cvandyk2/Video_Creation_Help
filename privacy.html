  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This policy describes how Autobot handles information.</p>
  <h3>Data We Process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Media files and post metadata you upload to schedule.</li>
    <li>Access tokens granted via platform OAuth to upload and schedule content.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How We Use Data</h3>
  <p>We use tokens solely to perform actions you request (e.g., upload videos, create scheduled posts). We do not sell personal data.</p>
  <h3>Storage & Retention</h3>
  <p>Tokens may be stored locally to keep your session active; you can revoke them via the platform at any time. Media is stored locally for scheduling and can be deleted by you.</p>
  <h3>Sharing</h3>
  <p>We do not share personal information with third parties except as required by law or as necessary to interact with the selected platforms’ APIs.</p>
  <h3>Your Rights</h3>
  <p>You can disconnect accounts or delete scheduled content at any time. For data requests, contact the app maintainer.</p>
